# Stunt Car VR — DE Test 1 "Drop & Dangle"

A Godot 4.7 / OpenXR **feel prototype**, not a game. It exists to answer
five questions in the headset (Quest 3 target):

1. Does the **Drop Start** — dangling under a drone on 4 lines, swaying,
   timing your own release — feel as good as it sounds?
2. Do the **jump and the descent** churn the stomach the right amount?
3. Does flipping the **prep switches while dangling** work as cockpit
   prep (a completed sequence pays out a small boost credit)?
4. Does **grabbing the wheel** and physically turning it steer well?
5. **Lean experiment:** does leaning into the banked corner for bonus
   grip feel like a real technique (bonus only, never required)?

Design contract: `../design-spec.md` (v0.1 as amended, items 1–16) and
`../build-brief-test1.md`. Deliberately NOT in this test: rivals/sumo,
loops, season, track designer, random tracks, boost pads, car choice,
real carnage (dent + smoke placeholder only), audio, multiplayer.

## The run

Drop Start dangle → time the release (touchdown is scored FLAT / OK /
ROUGH / HARD) → start straight → steep climb → banked left corner →
launch lip → **the gap** (cross it with speed; boost helps; fall and
the drone catches you) → descent → finish gantry.

Fall off anywhere, or call the drone yourself: it carries you back over
the ribbon, you dangle, you may flip the 3-switch prep sequence shown
on the dash (wrong switch = restart the sequence; finishing pays +25
boost), then you time the release again. Release away from the track
and you fall — and the drone catches you again.

## Controls (also listed on the in-cockpit panel — every command)

VR (Quest):
- **Grab wheel:** squeeze GRIP near the wheel, turn the hand. Last
  hand to grab drives; the other hand takes over when it lets go.
- Throttle: right trigger · Brake: left trigger · Boost: right A
  button (while driving)
- **Release from the drone:** right trigger (while dangling)
- Flip a prep switch / press a dash button: GRIP near it (while
  dangling)
- Call the drone (while driving): left X button
- Restart race: left Y button · Lean experiment on/off: right B button
  (or the green dash button; red dash button = restart)
- Recenter: click the left stick

Desktop fallback (no headset): the mirror rig drives the same car.
- W/S throttle/brake · A/D steer · SHIFT boost · SPACE release
- 1/2/3 flip FUEL/SPARK/BOOST · L call drone · R restart
- T lean experiment on/off · Q/E lean body left/right · C recenter
- Mouse drag steers while the left button is held

## Run it

Desktop: open the project in Godot 4.7 and run, or
`Godot_v4.7 --path . ` — with no HMD it boots into the fallback rig
automatically (window 1280×800, mouse/keyboard as above).

## Tests (all headless, all scripted through production code paths)

```
# logic smoke: drop start -> release -> touchdown scored -> climb ->
# bank held -> gap crossed airborne -> drone lift on demand -> prep
# sequence -> boost credit -> release -> driving -> lean grip A/B
# The smoke run first executes the API GUARD (reported separately):
# every XR API method/property the game code calls by name is asserted
# against ClassDB in the running engine. Hotfix 1 added it after
# main.gd called the nonexistent XRCamera3D.get_is_tracking() on a
# line that only executes in XR mode, wedging the live headset run;
# the HMD tracking check now goes through the head tracker's pose
# (XRServer.get_tracker("head") -> XRPositionalTracker.get_pose ->
# XRPose.has_tracking_data).
Godot --headless --path . --script tests/smoke_test.gd

# rendered-frame proof (needs GL; use Xvfb, NOT --headless):
# writes tests/cockpit_view.png and tests/lift_view.png and asserts
# the panel lists every command. Fix Pass 1 added two more captures:
# tests/sightline_view.png (long offset sightline, climb -> bank -> lip)
# and tests/ribbon_side_view.png (grazing side angle: ribbon thickness
# and skirt) - the track must visibly exist, not read as pylons only.
# Fix Pass 2: cockpit_view is shot from the driver eye anchor (fallback
# camera) and the proof asserts hub-vs-anchor reach geometry plus the
# recovery hang's centreline offset; the smoke asserts the same
# centring for the Drop Start and the recovery, and that a release at
# swing centre lands on the ribbon.
xvfb-run -a Godot --path . --script tests/render_proof.gd

# frame discipline probe (nodes / draw calls / primitives)
xvfb-run -a Godot --path . --script tests/frame_stats.gd
```

UNVERIFIED by design (XR layer — only a headset run proves these):
grab-wheel hand tracking, hand-proximity switch flips, HMD lean
reading, in-headset panel legibility, and (Fix Pass 2) the anchored
seat position and wheel reach comfort in the headset. The anchor:
recenter/spawn offsets the rig so the HMD lands on a fixed eye anchor
in the cockpit (hub 0.45 m ahead of the eye, 0.26 m below it); the
drone's hang points (Drop Start + recovery) are centred over the
ribbon centreline, over flat, unbanked sections.

## Quest export — status

The full chain is assembled and correct up to the last step:

- `export_presets.cfg`: preset **"Android Quest"** — arm64, Gradle
  build, XR Mode = OpenXR, Meta plugin enabled, Quest 3 support on.
- Godot OpenXR Vendors plugin 5.1.0-stable in `addons/godotopenxrvendors`.
- Android build template installed in `android/` (gitignored —
  regenerate any time via Project → Install Android Build Template).
- Toolchain used here (in `~/workspace/tools/android/`): Temurin JDK
  17, SDK platform 35 + build-tools 35.0.0 (fetched as direct zips —
  `sdkmanager` can't tunnel this sandbox's egress proxy), debug
  keystore generated; Godot editor settings point at both.

**Blocker in this sandbox:** Gradle builds fail because the Gradle
daemon's client↔daemon IPC dies here ("Could not receive a message
from the daemon" — the daemon starts, registers and accepts, then the
channel fails and it is stopped ~10 s later). Reproduced with a bare
`gradlew help` in `android/build/`, outside Godot, so it is the
sandbox environment, not the project. A non-Gradle template export
succeeds and signs, but the Vendors plugin's AAR/manifest integration
only applies to Gradle builds, so that APK would not register as a VR
app on Quest — it is deliberately **not** shipped.

On a normal desktop: open the project, confirm the Android preset,
Export → "Android Quest" → `builds/stunt-car-test1.apk`.
